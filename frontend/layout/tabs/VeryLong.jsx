        Well, ok. I hope you have some time to spare. Let's begin. I was born
        and raised in Medell√≠n, Colombia. I started coding at age 8 on an old
        Windows 3.1 machine with BASIC. Even then, I was learning IF's and
        GOTO's from old Commodore magazines found in my school's library. I
        remember I once made some sort of Dungeon Crawler, spent weeks imagining
        and planning. It was absurdly ambitious. I barely got 3 or for screens
        coded. That was a first lesson in understanding the scope of a project
        and the budget required. By the way, there's no reason to be reading
        this. It's way too long.

        At the time, I wrote simple games mostly, and a few rogue-ish text
        adventures. As I got interested in programming, my supportive family got
        me an expensive course on CD-ROMs, where I would learn Borland Delphi.
        It was pretty bad. Safe to say, I lost interest as a teenager. Also I
        got into music. Like, big time. I played bass (badly), guitar (ok I
        guess), and even sang (horrificly) for a band. Grew my hair long and
        used jean vests, you know, like a cool guy.

        After that, I got really into Free Software, since I got a Ubuntu LiveCD
        on the mail. I tried a lot of distros, ran GNU/Linux daily for most of
        my life and even contributed to some projects back in the day, using
        Subversion. That was my introduction to version control. I also made
        some graphic themes for GNOME and KDE. Used to have this crazy
        Compiz-Fusion desktop full of effects, and a Conky system monitor
        telling me all of the useless info my computer could monitor. Ok, it's
        time to stop. This is way too long.

        After high school, I studied Chemical Engineering on two of the top
        Universities in the country. Through my career I always focused on
        programatic solutions, took every CS course they offered, and learned
        Matlab, GNU/Octave, some Python and a bit of C++. I had a brief career
        in the chemical industry, before I decided to transition into
        development full time. My first CS assignment was writing a simple
        madlibs program. We were using a specific editor, with specific obsolete
        libraries for some function. Those didn't have linux versions. I got a
        3.2 (C- I guess) because I didn't use those libraries and used Eclipse
        to code.

        I have completed thousands of hours of online material, in several
        platforms, from Bootcamps to masterclasses. My favorite has to be Kent
        C. Dodds's "Epic React" and anything my Wes Bos. I still have a huge
        pile stuff to learn, and that makes me very happy. I have a problem
        buying courses. I often do projects that cover stuff I have done before
        just because I wat that dev's version of the material.

        After some time, I started taking freelance work, mostly simple sites
        and ecommerce websites on Wordpress and Woocommerce. In the way I
        acquired a lot of experience in basic graphic design, tools like Sketch,
        Figma, and AdobeXD, and Wordpress and the LAMP/LEMP Stack, including php
        theme and plugin development. I'm currently working on the MERN Stack,
        and I'm specially interested in applications in Headless CMS and as a
        Front end for modern REST or GraphQL based CMS. Well, if you truly read
        all of this wall of text, let me tell you, it was done as a joke, and a
        bad one, as that. It was not worth it. I told you.
