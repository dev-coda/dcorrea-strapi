        After high school, I studied Chemical Engineering on two of the top
        Universities in the country. I had a brief career in the chemical

        I have completed thousands of hours of online material, in several
        platforms, from Bootcamps to masterclasses. In the way I acquired a lot
        of experience in Wordpress and the LAMP/LEMP Stack, including php theme
        and plugin development.{" "}

        I'm currently working on the MERN Stack, and I'm specially interested in
        applications in Headless CMS and as a Front end for modern REST or
